# OOP_LOGIN_PHP
This is a basic object-oriented login and registration system I created in PHP while learning oop.
Anyway this isnt suitable for any real world applications.

I hope this will help anyone who is learning php and looking forward to hearing your opinions on this simple project,
so please contact me and send me a feedback about it. Thanks for your time.
